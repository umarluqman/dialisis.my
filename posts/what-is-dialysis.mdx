## Introduction

Dialysis is a medical treatment that helps filter blood when the kidneys are no longer functioning properly. This treatment is essential for patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD).

In Malaysia, there are more than 900 dialysis centers providing this service to patients.

## Types of Dialysis

There are two main types of dialysis:

### 1. Hemodialysis (HD)

Hemodialysis is a process where blood is circulated through a dialysis machine to be filtered. This process uses a special membrane to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood.

**Characteristics:**
- Performed at dialysis centers or hospitals
- Usually 3 times per week
- Each session takes about 4 hours

### 2. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)

Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) as a filter. A special fluid is introduced into the abdomen to absorb waste products.

**Characteristics:**
- Can be done at home
- Performed daily
- More flexible in terms of timing

## Preparing for Dialysis

Before starting dialysis treatment, patients need to:

1. Undergo surgery to create vascular access (fistula or graft)
2. Attend patient education sessions
3. Make necessary dietary changes
4. Choose a suitable dialysis center
