## Introduction

Researchers at the London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute (LHSCRI) and Western University, Canada, are conducting a large clinical trial to evaluate a new dialysis filter called Elisio HX™.

This new filter is specially designed by Nipro to remove more types of toxins than the standard filters currently in use. If effective, it could help kidney patients live longer and healthier lives, even while continuing regular dialysis treatment.

## What Makes Elisio HX™ Different?

Typically, dialysis filters can only remove basic waste and salts — not always mimicking true kidney function. The Elisio HX™ filter is designed to remove more harmful toxins that were previously difficult to eliminate. This may reduce the risk of heart problems, stroke, infections, and post-dialysis fatigue.

## About the DIALEX Study

The study called DIALEX will run for 5 years, involving nearly 4,800 patients across more than 100 dialysis centers in Canada, including rural hospital consortiums. Patients will be randomly divided — some using standard filters, others using the Elisio HX™ filter.

Researchers will evaluate whether the new filter:

- Increases patient lifespan
- Reduces hospital admissions (due to heart attacks, strokes, infections, etc.)
- Makes patients feel healthier and more energetic

## Why This Matters for Dialysis Patients

Many dialysis patients must undergo blood cleansing 3 times a week, with each session taking several hours. Quality of life can be affected, and prolonging kidney function decline is always a challenge. Therefore, any improvement in dialysis filters can have a significant impact on comfort and long-term outcomes.

Dr. Pavel Bhosanov, a kidney specialist and study researcher, said:

> "This study isn't just for scientists, but for patients. We want to ensure that everyone — including those in rural areas — has the opportunity to receive the best treatment without having to travel far."

This study is funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and Western's Health Data Research Network.

## Conclusion

The new Elisio HX™ filter is still under study, but it brings new hope. If successful, patients may feel lighter after dialysis, experience fewer cardiac complications, and have more energy for daily life.
