## Introduction

UC Davis Health in the United States is currently testing a new treatment with significant potential for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those caused by type 2 diabetes. This study, known as the Proact Study, is evaluating the effectiveness of a therapy called Renal Autologous Cell Therapy (REACT).

## What is REACT Therapy?

This treatment uses the patient's own kidney cells, obtained through a biopsy (small tissue sample from the kidney). These cells are selected, cultured in a laboratory, and then reinjected back into the patient's kidney.

The goal is to stimulate the natural healing process and restore kidney function damaged by diabetes.

## About the Study

- Involves 685 patients aged 30-80 years with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes
- Participants will be randomly divided — half receive the actual cell therapy, half receive a simulated treatment (placebo)
- The first injection is administered 12 weeks after biopsy, followed by monitoring for 5 years to observe long-term effects on kidney function

## What Does This Mean for Dialysis Patients?

Although this therapy is still in the research phase, it brings new hope. If successful, patients may not need to rely on dialysis continuously, or at least can delay kidney damage more effectively.

This treatment also uses the patient's own cells, so the risk of rejection is lower — a significant step toward more natural and personalized treatment.

## Conclusion

The REACT study is not yet available in Malaysia, but it shows that the medical world is getting closer to treatments that can repair, not just replace, kidney function.

For patients who need dialysis every week, this news carries an important message: *Hope for "relief" from dialysis machines may no longer be impossible in the future.*
